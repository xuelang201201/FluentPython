Description: Vaurien Client
        ##############
        
        This is a client for `vaurien <http://vaurien.rtfd.org>`_. It's a separate
        project to avoid getting all the dependencies of vaurien when you just want to
        control it.
        
        It uses `the vaurien's APIs
        <https://vaurien.readthedocs.org/en/latest/apis.html>`_ to change the behaviors
        on the proxy side.
        
        **vaurienctl** can be used to list the available behaviors, get the current one,
        or set it.
        
        Here is a quick demo::
        
            $ vaurienctl list-behaviors
            delay, error, hang, blackout, dummy
        
            $ vaurienctl set-behavior blackout
            Behavior changed to "blackout"
        
            $ vaurienctl get-behavior
            blackout
        
        Using the marteau extension
        ===========================
        
        *vaurienclient* can be plugged into the marteau mechanism, as a fixture. The
        fixture class lives in vaurienclient.ext.marteau.
        
        Here is how you can make it work with a `.marteau.yml` file::
        
            lookup:
                - vaurienclient.ext.marteau 
            fixtures:
                memcache_delay:
                    class: VaurienFixture 
                    arguments:
                        server: memcache
                        behavior: delay
            vaurien-proxies:
                memcache: http://memcache:0123
        
        There are different sections that can be useful here:
        
        * `lookup` tells marteau to load the fixtures that are available on
          `vaurienclient.ext.marteau`.
        * fixtures is the list of fixtures. you give them the class to Use (here the
          `VaurienFixture` class, and some arguments.
        * And then, the last bit is the list of poxies you want to use.
